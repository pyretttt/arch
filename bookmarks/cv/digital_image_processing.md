> Functions that are not periodic (but whose area under the curve is finite) can be expressed as the integral of sines and/or cosines multiplied by a weighting function. The formulation in this case is the Fourier transform, and its utility is even greater than the Fourier series in many theoretical and applied disciplines. Both representations share the important characteristic that a function, expressed in either a Fourier series or transform, can be reconstructed (recovered) completely via an inverse process, with no loss of information. This is one of the most important characteristics of these representations because it allows us to work in the Fourier domain (generally called the frequency domain) and then return to the original domain of the function without losing any information. Ultimately, it is the utility of the Fourier series and transform in solving practical problems that makes them widely studied and used as fundamental tools.

> Note that the Fourier transform is an expansion of f t( ) multiplied by sinusoidal terms whose frequencies are determined by the values of m. Thus, because the only variable left after integration is frequency, we say that the domain of the Fourier transform is the frequency domain.
