$$\begin{align}
R: SE(3) \rightarrow GL(n)
\end{align}$$
this is a mapping from special euclidean group element to corresponding general linear group.

Thereof each element of $SE(3)$ implicitly mapped to
$$\begin{align}
g \rightarrow R(g)
\end{align}$$

And it preserves following
$$\begin{align}
R(g^{-1}) = R(g)^{-1}
\end{align}$$
inverse of mapping _(on the right)_ is equal to mapping of inverse element _(on the left)_.

And
$$\begin{align}
R(g \circ h) = R(g)R(h)
\end{align}$$
